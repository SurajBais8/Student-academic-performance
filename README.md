Student academic performance
## Project Description

This project aims to develop a data-driven approach to understand and improve student performance using SQL. The analysis focuses on various factors such as gender, race/ethnicity, parental education level, lunch type, and test preparation course completion. By analyzing these factors, the project draws meaningful insights that can help improve educational outcomes and provide targeted recommendations for students.

## Objectives

- Analyze student performance based on different demographic and socio-economic factors.

- Identify the subjects in which students perform well and those in which they struggle.

- Understand the impact of test preparation courses on student performance.

- Provide insights and recommendations to improve student performance.

## Tech Stack

- SQL: For data analysis and querying.

- MySQL Workbench 8.0: For working, analyzing, and reporting insights.

- Microsoft PowerPoint: For presenting the detailed analysis.

- Power BI: For visualizing insights.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about students' performance in various subjects, along with their demographic and socio-economic background. The key columns in the dataset include:

- Gender
- Race/Ethnicity
- Parental Education Level
- Lunch Type
- Test Preparation Course Completion
- Math Score
- Reading Score
- Writing Score

## Recommendations

1. Participate in Test Preparation Courses:
- These courses are beneficial and can significantly boost performance.

2. Focus on Challenging Subjects:
- Allocate more study time and resources to subjects like Mathematics, where students generally struggle.
  
3. Utilize Strengths:
- Female students can build on their strengths in Reading and Writing to further their academic success. Male students should keep improving their Mathematics skills while also focusing on Reading and Writing.

4. Seek Help and Resources:
- Students should seek help from teachers, tutors, and peers, especially in subjects they find challenging.

5. Parental Involvement:
- Encouraging parents to be involved in their children's education can positively influence student performance.
